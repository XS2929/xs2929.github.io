**My experience of this course**

I'm giving my conclusion at the beginning, this is an awesome course. Yes, It's harder in summer than normal semesters. And yes, the project self-teaching process is, in some ways, harder than the Operating system course. But now I understand how a basic website works and gain confidence in working with a group. From IDB projects, I learned tons of stuff from my back-end teammates. I saw their passion in Computer Science which I don't have. I also know how to teach yourself using different online tools. I may not choose CS as my life career but the self-teaching and problem-solving skills will no doubt benefit me. From this course, we learned Python, XML, Database, JAVA and more. Even I am not good at all of them, the basic understanding of them still worth a lot. The experience is kind of like a summer internship, in an easier level. 
By the way, this is also a good course for writing flag, weekly blogs and group reports are not that hard to finish compared with other upper writing courses. The last thing left now is Test 2, I will try my best on it.
